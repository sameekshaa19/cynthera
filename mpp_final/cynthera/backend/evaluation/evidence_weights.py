"""Evidence weighting by causal grounding tier — evaluation-only comparator.

Design Rationale
----------------
Different evidence sources carry different epistemic reliability. A direct RCT-backed
clinical causal statement is more reliable than a structural database annotation.
The CausalGrounding enum already captures this tier structure.

WeightConfig translates causal grounding tiers into multiplicative weights for
use in the weighted alignment comparator.

CRITICAL NOTICE — CALIBRATION STATUS
--------------------------------------
The numerical weight values in the predefined WeightConfig instances below are
INITIAL HEURISTIC VALUES. They encode a scientific prior:
    DIRECT evidence > CURATED evidence > INFERRED evidence > STRUCTURAL/NONE

They are NOT empirically calibrated. Calibration requires a development set with
sufficient coverage of all three label classes (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, UNCERTAIN)
that is SEPARATE from the test set. We do not currently have such a set.

Do NOT tune these values to improve benchmark metrics on the TEST split.
Doing so would constitute train-test contamination.

Usage Scope
-----------
WeightConfig is used exclusively by:
1. TherapeuticAlignmentEngine.weighted_align_target() — evaluation comparator
2. EvaluationRunner.run_with_config() — when use_evidence_weighting=True

The production alignment path (TherapeuticAlignmentEngine.align_target()) uses
equal binary votes and is UNCHANGED by this module.
