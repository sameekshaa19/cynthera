"""Therapeutic Alignment Engine — Phase 4D.

Evaluates directional compatibility between a drug's molecular action on its target(s)
and the biological direction-of-effect / clinical requirements associated with that target and disease.

Core Principles:
1. Target-State Model: Genetic direction (LoF/GoF + protect/risk) and pharmacological data
   are translated into an explicit desired therapeutic target action (INHIBITION / ACTIVATION / UNKNOWN).
2. Evidence Independence: Raw database rows are clustered by deterministic independence groups
   (PMID/DOI/trial). Multiple collinear rows count as 1 independent vote.
3. Multi-Target Protection: Primary targets and secondary targets are evaluated independently
   before synthesizing an overall alignment.
4. Auditable Explanations: Every alignment verdict is supported by structured trace evidence.

        Applies causal-grounding-tier weights from WeightConfig to independence-grouped

            support_weight > 0 AND opposition_weight == 0 → SUPPORTS
            opposition_weight > 0 AND support_weight == 0 → OPPOSES
